# Directories
| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [data-unmodified](../../../../data-unmodified/) | This directory contains each of the SQL dump files I downloaded for this project. Some of the files once uncompressed exceeded not only the recommended file size limit of 50MB in GitHub but the hard-limit of 100 MB. Thus in my repository they are compressed. Note that I uncompressed them and then recompressed them using gzip -9, the -9 option yields maximum compression. |
